A topological space $\mathcal{X}$, also denoted $(\mathcal{S},\mathcal{T})$, is a collection containing the empty set, $\mathcal{S}$, and an associated topology $\mathcal{T}$ - a set of neighborhoods (subsets) of $\mathcal{S}$. Formally, the elements of  $\mathcal{T}$ are *open sets*, since the open set for a point $p\in \mathcal{S}$ will contain all other points sufficiently near $p$. A set is considered *closed* if its complement is open.
