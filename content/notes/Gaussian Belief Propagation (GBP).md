title: "Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP)"
---

With an understanding of Gaussian algebra, [[notes/Graphical Models]], tree decomposition, and variable elimination, it becomes apparent that GBP is nothing more than a clever application of the distributive law.

Graphical models also known as [[notes/Graphical Models|PGMs]].

The factor graphs are very interesting. [[notes/Graphical Models#Factor Graphs|kek]]

An interesting application is in SLAM algorithms with probabilistic model represented by a factor graph.
