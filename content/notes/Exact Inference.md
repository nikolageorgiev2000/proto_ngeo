title: "Exact Inference"
---

Given samples from a probabilistic model of a system, a frequent research question is to infer certain other properties about the system, or otherwise reduce the uncertainty in the sampled information - as in sensor fusion problems. In certain scenarios, if we make the right assumptions, we can compute exact, deterministic solutions. A classical example of such an algorithm is the Kalman filter, which generalizes to [[Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP)]].
