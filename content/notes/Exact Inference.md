title: "Exact Inference"
---

Given samples of a probabilistic model of a system, a frequent research question is to infer certain other properties about the system, or otherwise reduce the uncertainty in the sampled information - as in sensor fusion problems. In specially crafted scenarios with the right assumptions, it is possible to leverage the probabilistic model to obtain exact, deterministic solutions. This approach dates back to cybernetics and the 

[[notes/Graphical Models]] are particularly useful for obtaining intuition for how to create a model and perform efficient computations over it.
